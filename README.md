# Build a Next.js application with TypeScript and Azure OpenAI Service

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
It is developed using Typescript. The solution is utilizing Vercel AI SDK for the client components and invoking the Azure OpenAI services.  

Please refere the following resources to understand more details about the different components of this project.

- [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/guides/openai)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sujoy-saha/next-azure-openai-app.git
cd next-azure-openai-app
```

Get all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Set-up configuration:

Create a `.env.local` in the root directory and add the following configuration details.

```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = 'Replace with your Azure OpenAI Endpoint'
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY = 'Replace with you Azure OpenAI Key'
AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL = 'Replace with your OpenAI Model'
```

Run the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
